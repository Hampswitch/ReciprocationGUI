Look at simulated annealing algorithm - improve speed. check consistency of results
    Things to try:
        Perturb 1 point at a time instead of all points
        Create explicit schedule list instead of function-driven one
        Separate threshhold and perturb schedules
    Things to report:
        Report evaluation at each step (including estimate of mean and variance)

Performance comparisons
    Teaching strats:
        reciprocal
        achievableset

    Learning strats:
        UCT
        UCT-acceptable
            w/ schedule and w/o schedule
        UCT-envy
