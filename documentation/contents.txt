Scripts
  mksamplegraphs - script to make sample graphs for ratio enforcing functions
  
Visualizers
  annealvisualizer.py - textbox entry to display functions generated in SAparam files
  discretevisualizer.py - scripts to display functions generated for discrete strategies
  firstmove visualizer - textbox entry to display the effects of the first move on payoffs
  evaluatorGUI - run strategies against each other and evaluate the results
  GPvisualizer - Runs a gaussian process visualization algorithm - allows you to adjust the parameters
  gui - similar to evaluatorGUI, but instead of being able to select strategies, allows you to observe two strategies playing against each other move by move
        Includes graphical visualization
  KNNvisualizer - similar to GP visualizer, but buggy
  meshgui - create mesh based on startmove and responding move between 2 agents
  stepfuncvisualizer - display the threshold functions found by simulated annealing
  stratExplorer - Look at space of possible payoffs for various linear strategies
